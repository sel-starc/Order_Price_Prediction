# Order_Price_Prediction
A Machine Learning model to predict the order amount that customers can place in the upcoming days.

# Business Overview 
## Introduction to B2B Operations: 
The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other businesses on credit. When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same. This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. 
The simplest definition of accounts receivable is money owed to an entity by its customers. Correspondingly, the amount not yet received is credit and, of course, the amount still owed past the due date is Account receivables.

# Credit Check Department:
When a client receives an order, he validates the customer.
Then the client proceeds with verifying the available credit limit of the customer.
Once the credit limit gets verified, the client proceeds to check the purchase order sent to him by the customer.
Collecting purchase order from customers for inventory check
Calculating the exposure for a particular customer
Looking after the entire process of order inflow
Help the company provide services and products supply without hampering the cash inflow. 

# Problem Statement for ML Model 
The objective of the first half of the summer internship project is:
To build a Machine Learning Model to predict the order amount, customers might make in the upcoming days.

You will be receiving an orders dataset that contains the past orders information and behavior of various buyers. Based on the previous orders patterns, the ML model needs to predict what will be the amount of orders the customer is going to place in the upcoming days.
